  <br />
Some Arlo Services require an ongoing subscription. You agree to pay your subscription fee in advance. Your subscription period is stated in your Arlo subscription plan.

You may have a choice of subscription payment options and may change your selected payment option by notifying NETGEAR in accordance with the subscription plan. If for any reason you need to reactivate a terminated subscription you may be charged a reactivation fee. If you register for the Arlo Services under a promotional subscription fee, some additional restrictions may apply. Whatever your subscription payment option, your subscription fee does not include any services, features or functionality other than the Arlo Services as defined in the plan you choose. NETGEAR may offer multiple subscription plans with varying levels and services.</p>
<p><br />
  <strong>10. Payment authorization</strong><br />

If you signed up at a promotional rate any renewals past the promotional period shall be charged at the then effective subscription fee. Access to your Arlo Services will not be established until NETGEAR or its agent has verified that the credit card information is valid, accurate and that your credit card account is in good standing. NETGEAR may, at its discretion, change the Arlo Services fees from time to time and charge additional fees for features and functionalities that are not a part of the Arlo Services. NETGEAR will notify you by an email to the email address on record for your account in advance of any fee changes or new fees. NETGEAR may suspend or terminate your Arlo Services without notice upon rejection of any credit card charges or if your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seeks the return of payments previously made to NETGEAR for Arlo Services. You agree NETGEAR may  charge interest on all amounts due that remain unpaid for 30 days or more. The monthly interest will equal 1.5% of the past due amount or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, until the past due amount and interest is paid. Such rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to NETGEAR. NETGEAR may refer your account to a third party for collection in the event of ongoing default.</p>

  <br />

  <br />
  IN NO EVENT WILL NETGEAR AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY ERRORS THAT MAY APPEAR ON THE ARLO WEBSITES, THE VALIDITY, ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY ITEMS DISPLAYED ON THE ARLO WEBSITES AS PART OF THE ARLO SERVICES, LOST PROFITS, USE OF USER INFORMATION, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EQUIPMENT FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR OTHER INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE ARLO SERVICES OR USE OF THE ARLO SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT BY ANYONE ELSE, EVEN IF NETGEAR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO CASE WILL NETGEAR'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU AND ANYONE WHO USES THE ARLO SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT, FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER ANY THEORY OF LAW, EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO NETGEAR IN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THESE LIMITATIONS OF NETGEAR'S AND NETGEAR&rsquo;S SUPPLIERS' LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THESE TERMS.  Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Additionally, this provision is not intended to limit NETGEAR's liability in the event of NETGEAR's willful or intentional misconduct. Moreover, if NETGEAR mistakenly or wrongfully overcharges your account, this section does not limit NETGEAR's ability to refund such mistakenly or wrongfully overcharged amounts.</p>

  <strong>25. General information</strong><br />
  <br />
  <em>Entire Agreement.</em>&nbsp;These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and NETGEAR and govern your use of the Arlo Services superseding any prior agreements between you and NETGEAR with respect to the Arlo Services. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Arlo Services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.<br />
  <em>Choice of Law and Forum.</em>&nbsp;These Terms and the relationship between you and Arlo shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, using the English language in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.<br />
  <br />
  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND NETGEAR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br />
  <br />
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.<br />
  <br />
  <em>Waiver and Severability of Terms.</em>&nbsp;The failure of NETGEAR to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.<br />
  <br />
  <em>No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability.</em>&nbsp;You agree that your Arlo account is non-transferable and any rights to your Arlo ID or contents within your account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.<br />
  <br />
  <em>Statute of Limitations.</em>&nbsp;You agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Arlo Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<br />
